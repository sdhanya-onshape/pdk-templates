----
## Manifests

## Files
This directory consists of all the files needed by this module

## Templates
This directory contains all the template `.erb/.epp` files needed by this module

## Spec
This directory contains all the necessary code/data for unit tests

----
## Setup
This module was setup using PDK docker container and therefore contains a few necessary files needed by the PDK itself. Please do not remove them. All the files deemed unnecessary have already been removed.

Having the PDK container is necessary. No other setup is required.

### Validation
To validate all the files, use `pdk validate` option. From the terminal:
```
docker run --rm -it -v `pwd -P`/dist/nginx/:/code --workdir /code puppet/pdk validate --parallel
```
If you find any validation errors, you can pass the `--auto-correct` flag to the above command and run it. You can manually fix any other errors/warnings and re-run the above command to confirm if everything is good.

### Testing
To run unit tests, use `pdk test` option. From the terminal:
```
docker run --rm -it -v `pwd -P`/dist/nginx/:/code --workdir /code puppet/pdk test unit
```
This command will run all the unit tests specified in the `spec` directory and gives the report.
